# Site-wide stuff that should be set in groups_vars/all.yml or
# group_vars/your_group.yml - but you might want to override in
# host_vars/00005e00532a.yml for some.
#
# Note that the hostname in the inventory file is the MAC address of the phone.
# The templating operation is always delegate_to the provisioning server.

voipms_account: "123456"
voipms_server: "washington1.voip.ms"

# Credentials for the phone to talk to the provisioning server

provisioning_server: polyanna.example.org
provisioning_server_scheme: https
provisioning_server_username: PlcmSpIp
provisioning_server_password: some_password

# this is the login or front panel login pin/password for the phone - set site-wide
# or make unique per-phone for "special" people...
phone_password: 31337

# this is the number of seconds you are behind/west of (negative number) or ahead/east
# of (positive number) UTC - set site-wide and override per-phone or do whatever.
# Or just put God's own timezone (UTC) on all phones and show people how it's done.

# These variables you likely want to set in host_vars/00005e00532a.yml
#
# This is the password for sip registration, assumption is that you make
# it the same for all buttons on a phone, but variable between phones.
sippassword: "some_password"

# 1 for 24 hour clock, 0 for 12 hour clock
clock24: 1

# buttons array - minimum is just a series of labels - the defaults on
# the back end will do the needful.  for each item in the buttons array
# you can, however, override:
# 
# "label" (what it says on the button)
# "displayname" (caller ID, not honored by voip.ms sadly)
# "voipms_account" (account you register to)
# "sippassword" (goes with the registration account)
# "voipms_server" (the particular sip server you register to, need not actually be voip.ms)
# 
# 
# something like this, up to the
# maximum number of buttons your phone supports

buttons:

  - displayname: "7035551212"

  - label: "Spoof Cell (0001)"
    displayname: "7035550001"


# Each button on the phone is a separate SIP registration to voip.ms.
# They do subaccounts by concatenating account name + underscore +
# user-defined-subaccount-name (with serious restrictions on characters).

# For ClueTrust, the approved user-defined subaccount name is the last 6
# digits of the MAC address (no colons) plus a two digit button number
# starting at 01 (Polycom's button number index starts at 1 not 0).

# So, button 1 for voip.ms account 123456 Polycom phone MAC address
# 00:00:5e:00:53:2a would be 123456_00532a01

# This role handles all that on the back end in the phone config definitions.

# One last thing:  The VVX500 has crappy underpowered sidetone (hearing yourself
# in the handset when you talk).  There's a forums-documented-only parameter
# that lets you goose that around from a configuration file.  12 or 13
# seem to be good numbers for this:

sidetone: 13
